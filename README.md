## About Inspector Otter
Inspector Otter has made it his **life mission** to help **YOU** understand what in the world people are saying. In addition to chirping, purring, squealing, and gurgling, Mr. Otter is an avid English speaker with over 10+ years of experience sharing word definitions, translations, and synonyms with those who seek his knowledge. 
If you're struggling to understand a word you hear, why torture yourself and put yourself in agonizing pain researching that word day in and day out, only to discover upon completion that the word has already become obsolete. Inspector Otter can do the research for you in a quarter of the time and effort! Best of all, he will do it for **FREE**! You might be asking yourself, "Free!? What's the catch?". Well today's your lucky day as there is no catch whatsoever. Inspector Otter prides himself on doing all the heavy lifting for *YOU* so you can get back to **your life**! Why is Inspector Otter so generous and why does he do it for free you ask? Well, his charitableness comes from an incident which occurred many moons ago.
Previous PopStar Icon, Inspector Otter, left his lavish lifestyle behind him shortly after witnessing a miscommunication between two of his next door neighbors, Mr. Badger and Ms. Wolverine. As the story goes, Ms. Wolverine was helping Mr. Badger with some simple yard work. They were either picking apples, raking leaves or mowing the lawn, not important. When the work was completed, Ms. Wolverine exclaimed "That was a piece of cake!". Unbeknownst to Mr. Badger, he thought Ms. Wolverine said something along the lines of **_you're_ a piece of cake_**.
As Mr. Badger had been making extra effort to lose the extra 15 pounds he gained last winter, he took offense to her comments and scurried away into his burrow. 
Inspector Otter was casually eavesdropping on his neighbors conversation and recognized a language barrier between the two neighbors. As Inspector Otter was comforting Mr. Badger from the stressful ordeal, he explained that the phrase "*piece of cake*", when Ms. Wolverine used it, meant that the yard work was simple to accomplish. Upon hearing Otter's explanation, Mr. Badger was red, filled with embarrassment and hurried over to Ms. Wolverine's forest to apologize for his abrupt exit and for the misunderstanding. 
Inspector Otter recognizes that miscommunications happen everyday and wants to work hard so people like you and I will never have to struggle to understand words that are being used, and to never find themselves in a situation like Mr. Badger.
